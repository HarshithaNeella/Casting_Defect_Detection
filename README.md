🏭 **Casting Defect Detection using Machine Learning**

📌 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on automated visual inspection of industrial casting components using classical Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to classify casting images as Defective or Non-Defective, helping manufacturers reduce manual inspection effort and improve quality control.

🎯 **Problem Statement**

Manual inspection of casting parts is:

Time-consuming

Error-prone

Inconsistent across inspectors

This project builds a machine-learning based defect detection system that can automatically identify surface defects from casting images.

🧠 **Methodology**

The pipeline follows a classical ML workflow:

1.Image Preprocessing

  •Grayscale conversion

  •Image resizing (fixed size)

2.Feature Extraction

  •Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

3.Model Training

  •Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  •StandardScaler for normalization

4.Model Evaluation

  •Train/Test accuracy comparison

5.Deployment

🧪 **Machine Learning Model**

•Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

•Kernel: Linear

•Feature Engineering: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)

✅ **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates an effective casting defect detection system using classical Machine Learning techniques. By combining HOG feature extraction with a Linear SVM, the model achieves reliable performance while remaining lightweight and easy to deploy.
